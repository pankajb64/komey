hey there, before you exit run exit/exit_commands
#As a measure of safety, you should take backup for rummycircle at 54.254.244.122 with credentials from try
#well, firstly you have to build rummycircle-54.254.244.122 using try build tool on 192.168.50.202:8080
after that you will restart tomcat at 54.254.244.122 with credentials from try
finally you will execute base/restart_try_rc_static_android_apache
and just for time pass you can check the current directory by using send "pwd"
