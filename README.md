This is komey, the linguistic wizard bot.
-----------------------------------------
If you ask the wrong way, you will never know.

If you know the right way, you need only ask.

(Seriously, just check out the "command_mapping" file for a list of supported regex commands.

And check "commands/try_prac" for a few example commands.

Dont refer to the "command list" file as it is old and misleading)


To run :
---------

cd /path/to/komey/

python komey.py command/your_command
